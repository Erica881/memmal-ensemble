# üõ°Ô∏è Malware Detection using Ensemble Learning on Memory Dump Analysis

This project investigates and implements a malware detection framework using memory dump analysis combined with deep feature extraction and ensemble learning models. The objective is to improve classification accuracy and robustness in detecting malicious behaviors from memory artifacts.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Modern malware often evades traditional static detection methods. This project leverages memory forensics and machine learning to build a detection pipeline capable of identifying malicious processes using features extracted from memory dumps. It incorporates:

- Deep autoencoder-based feature extraction
- Stacked ensemble learning (multiple base classifiers + meta-classifier)
- Temporal data splitting for realistic evaluation
- Interpretability using SHAP values
- Key performance metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, FPR, FNR

## üìä Dataset and Features

- **Dataset Used**: Public memory dump dataset ‚Äì **MemMal-D2024**
- **Feature Source**: Extracted using the **Volatility framework**, capturing behavioral memory features such as working set size, thread count, and I/O activity.
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - **Missing Value Handling**: NaN imputation and filtering of corrupted entries
  - **Normalization**: Applied to continuous features to reduce variance scale issues
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Performed using **deep autoencoder** to extract latent features
- **Sequence Modeling**:
  - The project incorporates temporal behavior modeling using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

## üß† Model Architecture

1. **Autoencoder**: Compresses high-dimensional memory features into latent representations.
2. **Base Classifiers**: Includes Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC, XGBoost
3. **Meta-Classifier**: CatBoost or Logistic Regression used in stacking to combine predictions from base models.

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

To ensure the system's effectiveness and safety in malware detection:

- **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**
- **ROC-AUC**
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)** ‚Äì to minimize false alerts
- **False Negative Rate (FNR)** ‚Äì to reduce undetected malware risks
- **SHAP and Coefficients magnitude** ‚Äì to interpret feature contributions to predictions
